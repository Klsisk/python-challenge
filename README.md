# Python : Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background
Both of Python challenges encompasses a real-world situation where newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. 

### PyBank
Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company that will be provided as data set called [budget_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The Python script will analyze the financial records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
-	The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-	The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
-	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll
Create a Python script to analyze and modernize the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
-	A complete list of candidates who received votes
-	The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
